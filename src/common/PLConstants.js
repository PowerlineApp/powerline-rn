Personal Information may include, but is not limited to:\n●	Your name and physical address, email addresses, and telephone numbers\n●	Collecting Personal Information such as your name, email address, device ID, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites)\n●	Past transactional behavior conducted by You on the Services\n●	Information about your company such as the name, size and location of your company and your role within the company;\n●	Behavioral or demographic attributes or birthdate, when tied to personal identifiers\n●	Information obtained from third parties about your interests\nYou may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or to authenticate your login. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from us. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. American Civix may also collect additional information through your dealings with and use of the Services and non-American Civix websites, which does not disclose your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual. Additional information may include, but is not limited to:\n●	Internet Protocol address (\"IP address\") and information derived from your IP address such as your geographic location;\n●	Geographic location showing where You are using the Services;\n●	Information about your devices such as information contained in HTTP Headers (defined below) or other internet transfer protocol signals, browser or device type and version; operating system, user-agent strings and information about or from the presence or use of \"apps\" on your mobile devices, screen resolution, and your preferred language;\n●	Unique IDs such as a cookie placed on your computer, mobile or device IDs;\n●	Behavioral data and information about your usage of the Services, including webpages clicked, websites and content areas visited, date and time of activities;\n●	The web search you undertook to locate and navigate to the Services.\nWe might also may put together additional information with Personal Information, such as gathering geographical location from your IP address and combining all of this with behavioral data about your usage of the Services with your name. If we combine additional information with personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.\nWe may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide and share that information to the public and our external partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to an external  partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. \nPowerline is designed to help you share information with your large public communities. Most of the information you provide us through Powerline is information you are asking us to make public to those groups and the users who own, manage, or participate in those groups. You may provide us with profile information such as a short biography, interests, your location, your website, date of birth, or a picture, among other information. Additionally, your public information includes the posts, petitions, comments, and other content you create using Powerline; the metadata provided with that content, such as when it was created and from which client application is originated; information about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time zone; and the groups you create or join, users you follow or allow to follow you, content you upvote, downvote, sign, or otherwise engage with (such as by commenting or sharing) on Powerline. Powerline broadly and instantly disseminates your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate public Powerline content into their services, and organizations such as universities, public health agencies, and market research firms that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like posts, petitions, comments, polls, fundraisers, events, discussions, photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. When you create a post or petition, your followers will receive a Direct Notification about that content. When you share another user’s post or petition, your followers will receive a Direct notification about that content. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in. Most Powerline content is set to expire automatically after some time, but you do have some ability to delete posts, petitions, and comments you create. We provide you and your groups some settings to limit the visibility of your Information. This does not prevent another user from sharing your information in more public spaces in or beyond Powerline. For certain profile information fields we provide you with visibility settings to select who can see this information in your profile. If you provide us with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public. You can change the language and time zone associated with your account at any time using your account settings, but the system will default to your local device language and time.\nPowerline may provide you with certain features that allow you to communicate more privately. For example, you can use a Chat or Huddle to have private conversations with other Powerline users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending and receiving Chat Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to them. Please note that if you interact with public Powerline content shared with you via a Chat Message or Direct Notification, for instance by upvoting a post in a Direct Notification, those interactions may be public. Whether you use features like Chat Messages or Posts, Petitions, and Other Content to communicate with your groups, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your communications without your approval.\nAdvertisers: Though we do not currently have advertisers, we may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in a form that is not personally identifiable to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact if you are located in Los Angeles to show you ads or offers for Los Angeles non-profits, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach."
